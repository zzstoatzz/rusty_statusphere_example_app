# Status App Progress

## Completed âœ…

### Core Functionality
- Forked from Bailey Townsend's Rusty Statusphere
- Multi-user support with BlueSky OAuth authentication
- Custom lexicon: `io.zzstoatzz.status.record` with emoji + optional text
- Status expiration times (30min to 1 week)
- Real-time updates via Jetstream firehose
- Public profiles at status.zzstoatzz.io/@handle
- Global feed showing all statuses
- Database persistence on Fly.io

### OAuth Implementation
- Fixed OAuth callback error handling (missing 'code' field)
- Reverted to working state with `transition:generic` scope
- Research complete: No granular permissions available yet in AT Protocol
- Must use broad permissions until Auth Scopes feature ships

### UI/UX
- One-time walkthrough for new users (stored in localStorage)
- Fixed double @ symbol in feed username links
- Fixed feed ordering (newest first by startedAt)
- Emoji picker with visual selection
- Status expiration display with relative times

## Current State ðŸš§
- App deployed and functional at status.zzstoatzz.io
- OAuth works but requires broad permissions (AT Protocol limitation)
- All core features operational

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

### Immediate
1. **Persistent Session Storage**: Users currently must re-login each visit
2. **UI Polish**: Small visual improvements needed

### Location Feature (Proposed)
- Add optional location to statuses
- Browser geolocation API integration
- Privacy controls (location blurring)
- Future: Integrate with SmokeSignal's location standards
- Vision: Global map of statuses

### Future Considerations
- Migrate to granular OAuth scopes when available
- H3 hexagon location support
- SmokeSignal event integration
- Location-based discovery

## Technical Debt
- OAuth scopes too broad (waiting on AT Protocol)
- Session persistence needed
- Location feature architecture planned but not implemented

## Resources
- OAuth research: `/tmp/atproto-oauth-research/`
- Location proposal: `/tmp/atproto-oauth-research/location_integration_proposal.md`
