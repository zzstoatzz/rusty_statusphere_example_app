# Custom Emoji Implementation Status

## What's Done âœ…
- Database schema created for `custom_emojis` table with fields:
  - `id`, `name`, `filename`, `alt_text`, `category`, `addedAt`
- CustomEmoji struct and database operations in `src/db.rs`
- API endpoint `/api/custom-emojis` that returns list of custom emojis
- Static file serving configured for `/emojis` directory
- "Custom" button added to emoji picker UI
- JavaScript to load and display custom emojis when Custom tab is clicked
- CSS styling for custom emoji display

## What's Not Done Yet ðŸ“‹

### 1. Add Actual Custom Emojis
No custom emoji images have been added yet. The `/static/emojis` directory exists but is empty.

To add custom emojis:
1. Place image files (PNG, GIF, etc.) in `/static/emojis/`
2. Use the script at `/scripts/add_custom_emoji.py` or manually insert into database:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO custom_emojis (name, filename, alt_text, category, addedAt) 
   VALUES ('partyparrot', 'partyparrot.gif', 'Party Parrot', 'custom', <timestamp>);
   ```

### 2. Handle Custom Emojis in Feed Display
When a status is set with a custom emoji (stored as `custom:emoji_name`), the feed and profile pages need to:
- Detect the `custom:` prefix
- Look up the emoji filename from the database
- Display the image instead of text

Current code stores custom emojis as `custom:emoji_name` in the status, but display logic hasn't been updated.

### 3. Search Integration
Custom emojis aren't included in the emoji search functionality yet. Need to:
- Include custom emojis in search results when user types in search box
- Match on emoji name and alt_text fields

### 4. Admin Interface
No UI for admins to upload/manage custom emojis. Currently would need direct database access or scripts.

## Next Steps
1. Add some test custom emoji images to `/static/emojis/`
2. Run the add script or manually insert database entries
3. Update status display templates to handle `custom:` prefix
4. Test that custom emojis appear correctly everywhere

## Current Behavior
- Clicking "Custom" tab shows empty grid (no emojis loaded)
- If custom emojis were added to DB, they would appear as clickable images
- Selecting one would set status to `custom:emoji_name` but wouldn't display correctly in feed yet
